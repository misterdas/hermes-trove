# Changelog

This repo also publishes GitHub Releases. This file is the repo-root release surface for operators who want the recent release arc without leaving the checkout.

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- **Unbounded re-ingest growth**: a host that replays its message history after a restart re-sent every stored row on every turn. The reconcile cursor advanced only on a *front-anchored ordered* match, which an interleaved replay never produces, so a restarted session re-appended its entire history each turn — 23,436 rows for a single session, growing ~1,000 per turn. `reconcile.py` now also reconciles with an **order-blind membership cursor**: durable membership in stored history is matched as a multiset (with a surplus-repeat proof) and skipped. Verified on a live session: 536-row replay window reconciles to cursor 520, adding 16 rows instead of 536.
- `/trove doctor duplicate apply` repoints `summary_nodes.source_ids` when it collapses rows, so rollup nodes keep referencing surviving rows instead of pointing at deleted `store_id`s.

### Added

- **Front-anchored ordered cursor** (`reconcile.py`): handles the replay shape membership cannot see, when the window starts at the head of stored history. Gated on an ordered-repeat proof, because a front match alone is not evidence of a replay — stored history can legitimately open with what the host just sent, and skipping there would drop the new rows behind it.
- `idx_msg_identity_ts_fallback` (`db_bootstrap.py`): `idx_msg_identity` keys on `observed_at` raw and SQLite treats NULLs as distinct in a UNIQUE index, so a row with `observed_at IS NULL` opted out of uniqueness entirely. Folds a missing `observed_at` onto `ingested_at` so those rows still participate. Partial (`WHERE observed_at IS NULL`) so it never competes with the primary index, and a passive migration retry rather than a delete. Only catches a re-send **within the same second** — a cheap extra net, not the re-ingest fix.
- **`/trove doctor duplicate [apply]`** (`command.py`): the operator tool that collapses re-ingested rows and re-points chunk references, so existing damage is cleaned without waiting for the ingest loop to stop. Read-only by default; `apply` is denied unless `TROVE_DOCTOR_CLEAN_APPLY_ENABLED=true`. Conservative by design — a repeat shorter than 5 consecutive rows is treated as legitimate and kept.

Full suite: 3390 passed, 2 skipped, 12 xfailed. ruff clean.

## v1.2.2 - 2026-09-26

### Fixed

- **Intra-process multi-writer corruption**: a process-wide write lock keyed by resolved database path, so `MessageStore` and a `VectorStore` opened by the background embedding worker serialize their write transactions instead of interleaving on one WAL.
- **Writes to a damaged store**: the startup index self-heal now refuses to auto-repair page-level damage, and the write gate stays closed instead of letting new writes turn a partially-recoverable database into an unreadable one.
- **POSIX `fcntl` lock stripping** in `_init_db`: closing any descriptor to the database inode silently released every POSIX record lock; lock-release work now runs before SQLite attaches, and `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` is used on append.
- `mmap` is disabled by default — it corrupted a live multi-writer store on this host.
- Doctor trusts only generated ingest references found inside parsed JSON values, never quoted legacy markers.
- A killed backfill run no longer strands its lease.
- Embed backfill treats a missing `remaining:` key as unknown rather than zero, keeps the chunk backlog alive when the summary pass has nothing pending, and makes every summary-pass exit explicit so a bail-out re-arms.
- `/trove embed status` renders `last_backfill_at` in the system timezone. The column is still STORED in UTC; only the display converts.

### Added

- Opt-in background backfill for the chunk corpus (`TROVE_EMBED_CHUNK_AUTO_BACKFILL=1`), so verbatim recall stays current without a manual backfill after every session. The corpus is raw operator text, so it stays behind explicit consent.
- `TROVE_EMBEDDING_THREADS` to cap fastembed/ONNX worker threads, so a backfill cannot saturate every core on a small host and starve the interactive turn.
- `AGENTS.md`, the repo's developer guide.

## v1.2.1 - 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- Synchronize store shutdown with active writers so a close cannot close a shared SQLite connection underneath an in-flight operation.
- Make `QueryViewStore` write transactions re-entrant using nested SQLite savepoints.
- Make engine shutdown explicit and idempotent across repeated lifecycle calls.
- Correct the release validator's stale stress-test path.

### Added

- Safe SQLite failure metadata: store, operation, database path, error class, SQLite code, and retryability — without SQL, parameters, or conversation content.
- `trove_doctor` maintenance-health reporting for rollup and embedding-backfill debt.
- `trove_doctor` recovery/degradation metrics for ingest failures, proactive recall, and maintenance debt.
- Offline release persistence smoke covering ingest, DAG summary, FTS, deterministic semantic recall, shutdown, and reopen.

## v1.2.0 - 2026-09-24

### Added

- **Session retention** (`retention.py`, `/trove doctor retention` + `retention apply`): opt-in cleanup of stale sessions' RAW messages while keeping summary nodes, so recall survives through the summaries.
  - `TROVE_RETENTION_DAYS` is the safety threshold (0 = retain forever, the default); `TROVE_RETENTION_APPLY_ENABLED` (default true) is the hard switch for shared setups.
  - Backup-first, one-transaction atomic delete: messages + FTS (via trigger) + chunk archives + eligible lifecycle rows; pinned messages refuse the whole apply; the live session is always protected.
  - `install.sh` now writes `TROVE_RETENTION_DAYS=0` to `.env` alongside the slash-command line.

### Fixed

- **Concurrency**: both coordinated-delete paths (`_delete_clean_candidates_atomically`, `_delete_retention_candidates_atomically`) now hold `store._write_lock` around their `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction. Without this, a concurrent `append()` on the shared connection could raise "cannot start a transaction within a transaction" or commit a half-done delete.
- **Retention preview/apply scope**: preview is now store-wide, matching the destructive apply exactly.
- **Pin-check TOCTOU**: pinned-message check runs inside the delete transaction; a pin landing after the pre-check still blocks the whole apply.
- **Installer config.yaml merge** (maintainer note): the standalone installer previously appended a duplicate top-level `plugins:`/`context:` block — invalid YAML that silently drops existing plugins. Now a YAML-aware in-place merge (with safe manual-instructions fallback when PyYAML is unavailable).

### Changed

- **Hook registration** (maintainer note): `post_llm_call` now registers via the public `ctx.register_hook()` API (declared in `provides_hooks`) instead of appending to the private `PluginManager._hooks` list; legacy hosts fall back to the old path.
- **Skill hygiene** (maintainer note): the maintainer release procedure moved from the model-facing `SKILL.md` to `references/release.md`.

- Full suite green: 122 retention tests + complete engine/command suites pass across Python 3.11–3.14.

## v1.0.0 - 2026-09-21

### Added

- Sufficiency gate (`sufficiency_gate.py`, mode
  `TROVE_PREANSWER_EVIDENCE_MODE=sufficiency_v1`): the preanswer evidence
  pipeline now delivers an explicit sufficiency verdict with every result —
  `answer_sufficient` / `computation_sufficient` / `finite_coverage` map to
  *answer*, `partial` to *answer with disclosure* (rendered exclusively from
  fields already stored on the result), and `unknown` / `conflicted` to
  *annotate* (disclose rather than stay silent).  States where the pipeline
  performed no evidence work (feature boundaries, unsupported questions,
  ordinary routes) receive no claim at all: unmarked stays unmarked.
  The gate never calls a provider and never mutates evidence, computation,
  or the delivered context of sufficient results.  Gate application is
  atomic (a gate crash can never leave a partially marked result; the
  wrapper fails open to the legacy result), delivered compiler states are
  never overridden by reason-code classification, and the compiler's trace
  digest remains re-derivable from every gated result.  Default-off; every
  other mode is byte-identical to its previous behavior.

## v1.1.4 - 2026-09-22

### Added

- Install script (`scripts/install.sh`): auto-creates plugin + skill symlinks,
  appends `plugins.enabled` + `context.engine` to config.yaml, sets
  `TROVE_ENABLE_SLASH_COMMAND=1` in `.env`, idempotent on re-run.
- Uninstall script (`scripts/uninstall.sh`): removes symlinks, strips config
  sections, cleans `.env`, idempotent.
- Slash command toggle: `TROVE_ENABLE_SLASH_COMMAND=1` in `.env` enables
  `/trove` commands (status, recall, store, forget, grep, compact, health,
  config, rotate).
- All tests green: 3178 passed, 0 failed, 1 skipped, 12 xfailed.

## v1.0.0 - 2026-09-03

### Highlights

- Harden untrusted prompt, externalized-payload, dependency, and SQLite file
  boundaries while keeping optional assertion, query-view, pre-answer evidence,
  embedding, and adaptive-retrieval paths disabled by default (#557).
- Preserve active-runtime slash-command routing and durable cumulative
  compaction telemetry across session rollover, restart, concurrent updates,
  and response-hook persistence (#526).
- Make concurrent startup safer by serializing deep FTS bootstrap repair and by
  reconciling legitimate transient SQLite rollback-journal disappearance
  without relaxing stable symlink, hardlink, or path-swap rejection (#570,
  `c368323`).

### Changed

- #526 binds slash commands to the active runtime and makes cumulative
  compaction counts durable across restart and session rollover.
- #557 adds exact 900,000-token caps for the three proven bare Codex routes on
  `openai-codex`, publishes the host-owned dependency assurance contract, and
  hardens prompt, payload, storage, backup, and sidecar boundaries.
- #570 serializes constructor-time FTS repair, rechecks the complete FTS state
  after acquiring ownership, and preserves caller-owned transaction behavior.
- `c368323` tolerates only verified transient rollback-journal disappearance or
  unlink windows during SQLite artifact restriction. It also replaces a
  scheduler-sensitive Voyage timing assertion with deterministic bounded-return
  and exactly-once-dispatch synchronization; production provider behavior is
  unchanged.

### Upgrade and rollback notes

- This is a prerelease candidate, not the stable v1.0.0 release. The tag-driven
  workflow marks it as a prerelease and does not make it the latest release.
- Before updating, use `/trove backup` while Hermes is live, or stop every SQLite
  writer and copy `trove.db`, `trove.db-wal`, and `trove.db-shm` together as one
  quiescent snapshot. Update the plugin, restart Hermes, send one normal
  message, then verify `plugin_version: 1.0.0` and the expected database
  path with `trove_status`.
- The core schema remains version 5. No manual migration or embedding backfill
  is required, and a stock/default-off upgrade creates no optional feature
  tables. Restore the pre-upgrade snapshot before downgrading if an optional
  store was enabled after the update.

## v0.21.0-rc2 - 2026-08-05

### Changed

- #492 corrects the optional `tiktoken` trajectory-state chunking path to
  preserve UTF-8 character boundaries while keeping each decoded chunk within
  its token budget. If the budget cannot contain one complete Unicode
  character, the path fails explicitly instead of emitting replacement
  characters.

## v0.21.0-rc1 - 2026-08-03

### Highlights

- Add the trajectory/experience-memory subsystem and the opt-in assertion,
  evidence, query-view, and adaptive-retrieval surfaces delivered by the
  consolidated wave-1 merge (#436).
- Keep the core SQLite schema at version 5. New feature stores use additive,
  named migrations in the same profile database, while disabled/default-off
  installs do not create optional assertion, query-view, or embedding tables.
- Improve large-store and startup behavior with bounded vector/metadata work,
  lock-contention retry during WAL conversion, and deferred temporal-rollup
  maintenance (#361, #440, #446, #447).

### Changed

- #436 adds the consolidated trajectory/experience-memory, retrieval,
  exact-evidence, citable-delivery, privacy, scale, and release-validation wave.
  Its committed benchmark results are directional evidence for the documented
  harness and corpus, not universal provider or workload guarantees.
- #361 retries WAL conversion when connection setup meets lock contention.
- #440 moves temporal-rollup maintenance off the session-start critical path;
  bounded background work is eventual and `trove_recent` retains its fallback.
- #446 and #447 batch large fixture setup for embedding/vector metadata release
  coverage without changing runtime behavior.

### Upgrade notes

- Back up `trove.db`, update the plugin checkout, restart Hermes, send one normal
  message, then verify `plugin_version: 0.21.0-rc1` and the expected database
  path with `trove_status`. The core schema remains version 5.
- No manual core migration or embedding backfill is required from v0.20.0.
- Query/evidence tool schemas are exposed after upgrade, but assertion
  extraction, assertion storage, query-view storage, pre-answer evidence, and
  adaptive retrieval remain opt-in. Review provider/privacy boundaries before
  enabling model- or embedding-backed paths.

## v0.20.0 - 2026-07-23

Release focus: Lossless-Claw parity plus the merged cross-session recall and temporal retrieval stack.

- Completed the five selected Lossless-Claw parity behaviors: recoverable active-replay stubs for large externalized tool results; token-bounded fresh tails that preserve the newest message and complete tool-call/result groups; dry-run-first historical tool-output backfill with guarded rollback; bounded active-session externalized-payload search with strict ownership and recoverability checks; and bounded atomic threshold full sweeps with one final active-context publication. (#380, #381, #382, #413)
- Shipped the merged #413 recall and temporal surface: `trove_recall`, `trove_recent`, and `trove_load_session`; semantic and hybrid retrieval over summaries and message chunks; temporal rollups with bounded fallback; optional proactive recall; and the corresponding benchmark and reproduction documentation.
- Release boundary: stock installs keep large-output externalization, active-replay stubbing, embeddings, temporal rollups, proactive recall, and threshold full sweeps disabled by default. Payload search requires explicit `content_scope`; historical backfill remains an operator-invoked, dry-run-first command. Committed benchmark results are directional evidence under their documented model and harness, not a universal provider-parity claim. This release does not include the later work tracked in #423, #434, or #436.

## v0.19.0 - 2026-07-07

Release focus: data-safety hardening, operator diagnostics, import tooling, benchmarking, and the WS5 engine decomposition.

- Hardened lossless storage and replay boundaries: GC tombstones preserve surrounding text, ingest failures surface in status/doctor, ignored-message drops are counted, persisted Hermes tool outputs and redacted durable retries replay losslessly, and auxiliary bypass/session fallback edge cases are covered. (#298, #308, #310, #312, #313)
- Strengthened storage and downgrade safety with serialized lifecycle/DAG writes, monotonic frontiers, path-contained externalized payloads, ReDoS-safe redaction, wrapped-base64 handling, a summary spend guard, and a schema-too-new open guard. (#300, #301, #302)
- Added operator and migration surfaces: read-only `trove_inspect`, JSONL session export import, compression no-op status, compaction telemetry, benchmark-backed preset validation, and steady-state hot-path benchmarks. (#295, #303, #306, #307, #309, #320)
- Added CI-backed ruff linting and release/validation-friendly tooling updates, including follow-up JSONL import hardening and metadata JSON access through `MessageStore`. (#314, #315, #316)
- Began and documented the behaviour-preserving WS5 decomposition of the ~9k-line `engine.py`: stateful method clusters became `*Mixin` classes (`compaction.py`, `reconcile.py`, `aux_session.py`, `placeholder_ledger.py`) mixed back into `TROVEEngine`, and pure/helper groups became plain modules (`engine_registry.py`, `codex_routing.py`, `sqlite_util.py`, `runtime_identity.py`, `message_analysis.py`). (#323, #324, #325, #326, #327, #328, #329, #330, #331, #332, #333, #334, #335, #336, #337, #338, #339)

## v0.18.1 - 2026-06-30

Release focus: compaction privacy, clone/hook integrity, doctor signal accuracy, and model-context safety.

- Excluded ignored backlog and stripped injected context before compaction, preventing ignored or synthetic context from entering TROVE summaries. (#283, #282)
- Preserved Discord lane metadata, active TROVE clone resolution, and context metadata through cloned engines and post hooks. (#292, #293, #289)
- Hardened runtime identity, raw tool call integrity refs, payload integrity checks, and doctor path/lifecycle diagnostics. (#281, #278, #279, #291, #273, #280)
- Updated Codex OAuth effective context window safety defaults. (#274, #276)
- Completed focus-topic demotion behavior and preserved raw session ownership across compression rollover. (#268, #269)
- Refreshed operator docs, community-health files, and release-validation guidance. (#272)

## v0.18.0 - 2026-06-18

Release focus: retrieval depth, durability, status provenance, and long-session correctness.

- Added recursive evidence support for `trove_expand_query`, improving synthesized answers from expanded TROVE context. (#266)
- Hardened externalized payload durability. (#265)
- Avoided duplicate ingest protection work on hot paths. (#262)
- Aggregated DAG status stats for cheaper health surfaces. (#264)
- Preserved source lineage after long sessions. (#263)
- Surfaced TROVE config provenance in runtime status. (#261)
- Fixed per-turn ingest for WebUI sessions and batch timestamp deduplication. (#260)

## v0.17.0 - 2026-06-14

Release focus: automatic focus-topic derivation and lifecycle hygiene.

- Added auto-derived focus topics during compression.
- Added empty lifecycle-row garbage collection to prevent unbounded accumulation. (#256)
- Improved runtime context indicators.

## v0.16.x - 2026-06

Release focus: engine isolation, WAL durability, database-path clarity, and startup cost control.

- Isolated TROVE engine state per agent. (#247)
- Preferred bound sessions on sibling chains when the host has zero DAG.
- Tuned compaction defaults and clarified context-threshold ownership. (#245)
- Clarified `TROVE_DATABASE_PATH` override behavior. (#249)
- Hardened WAL durability and graceful-close checkpoints. (#237)
- Throttled startup FTS integrity checks to reduce launch time. (#236)
